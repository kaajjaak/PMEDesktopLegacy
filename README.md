# Productivity Made Easy

A desktop program usage tracker that stores its data on a online API in order to work cross platform.


## Information

I originally made this as my final project to graduate from highschool. This project was very rushed, though this version, the desktop version should be fully functional and without bugs.

Although it is functional, it is not well designed as I focused exclusively on programming the required features.

The API used to be hosted for free on Heroku but they currently do not offer the free tier anymore so the API is therefore offline. The MySQL database hosting itself was provided by my highschool which I now graduated from and is therefore also offline.

## Rewrite

I'm currently working on a complete rewrite of the project since I do believe this project had a lot of potential that it has not yet reached. It will be a very different tech stack so this repository will therefore not be updated but I will link the new project once I have a public repository for it.
